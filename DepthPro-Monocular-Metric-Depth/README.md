### To run:
```python
!git clone https://github.com/apple/ml-depth-pro.git
cd ml-depth-pro
```

```python
#setup
!pip install -e .
```

You will need to download the pre-trained checkpoint using the following bash command which will place the model under `ml-depth-pro/checkpoints/depth-pro.pt` folder.

**Download checkpoints**:
`source get_pretrained_models.sh`

**Image Inference â€“ Usage**

```
!depth-pro-run -i image.jpg -o output_dir
```

The input can be an image or a directory containing multiple images, the `output_dir` will store the resulting inverse depth maps.

We have modified the `ml-depth-pro/src/depth_pro/cli/run.py`  to save raw depth and surface normal and is named as `depthpro-app.py`

---

To run,
`python depthpro-app.py`

To visualize metric depth per each pixel with a interactive OpenCV window, run 

`python metric-depth-visualize.py`
