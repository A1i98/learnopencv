# AnomalyCLIP : CLIP for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Recognition

This repository contains 2 python scripts for inferencing AnomalyCLIP Video Anomaly Recognition on videos. The 'infer_npy_pure.py' script helps to inference on the samples present in the original UCF-Crime Dataset on which the AnomalyCLIP has been trained and tested. The second script 'infer_raw_frames.py' file works on any raw video containing anomalies or even without them. Proper instructions has to be followed as suggested in the blog post.  


It is part of the LearnOpenCV blog post - [AnomalyCLIP : CLIP for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Recognition](https://learnopencv.com/anomalyclip-video-anomaly-recognition/).
