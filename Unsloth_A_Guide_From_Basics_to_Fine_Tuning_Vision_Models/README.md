# Unsloth: A Guide from Basics to Fine-Tuning Vision Models

This repository contains one Jupyter notebook and two Python files. The Jupyter notebook is for demonstrating fine-tuning code for fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B model on the LaTeX_OCR dataset. Fine-Tuning of the models is done on LaTeX_OCR dataset. One of the Python file can be used for converting ShareGPT chat template to ChatML chat template and the other one can be used for converting ChatML chat template to ShareGPT template.

Jupyter notebook is executable on Google Colab with T4 Tesla GPU, allowing readers to quickly test the model on the dataset with only taking 3000 training samples with minimal setup.
