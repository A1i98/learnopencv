### Run Inference

Run the `qwen.py` for **Qwen 2.5-VL** inference and `app.py` for comparison between **Qwen 2.5-VL** and **Gemma 3** 

**Note** - The Model and the Code requires a efficient consumer GPU like **Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Laptop GPU** or **Nvidia Tesla T4** to run the inference. 

### PS: This Fine Tuning requires at least **`> 16 GB`** of **VRAM**.
