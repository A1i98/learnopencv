The patient, who is a 60-year-old female, has several notable medical conditions and history items documented:
1. **Unspecified Anxiety Disorder**: This condition was listed as a current issue.
2. **Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm of Dissecting Type**: She underwent Endovascular Aneurysm Repair using an Ancure Graft on October 13, 2010, to address this condition.
3. **Deep Vein Thrombosis in the Left Lower Extremity and Post-Surgical Venous Thrombotic Disorder**: This is related to her recent surgical history.
4. **Mild to Moderate Peripheral Neuropathy of Feet and Toes**: The neuropathy is noted not to interfere with her daily activities.
5. **History of Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Dissection (October 2008)**: Previously treated emergency that required significant medical intervention.
