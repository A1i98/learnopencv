# Fine-Tuning Grounding DINO: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection

This repository contains three Python files. The "fine_tune_grounding_dino.py" python is for demonstrating fine-tuning code for fine-tuning Grounding DINO model on the Face Mask Detection Dataset. "test_fine_tuned_grounding_dino.py" python file will be used for testing the fine-tuned Grounding DINO model while "create_annotations_final.py" python file will be used for converting the original Face Mask Detection dataset annotations to the format desired by the Grounding DINO.
