# Fine-Tuning Gemma 3 VLM using QLoRA for LaTeX-OCR Dataset

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks, one for demonstrating how to use Gemma 3 for inference on a few samples from the LaTeX_OCR dataset without fine-tuning and the other one for fine-tuning code for training Gemma 3 on the LaTeX_OCR dataset. Fine-Tuning of the models is done on LaTeX_OCR dataset.

First notebook is executable on Google Colab, allowing readers to quickly test the model on sample data with minimal setup. Due to the memory-intensive nature of fine-tuning such large models, this notebook should be run on Lightning AI Studio for optimal performance.


It is part of the LearnOpenCV blog post - [Fine-Tuning Gemma 3 VLM using QLoRA for LaTeX-OCR Dataset](https://learnopencv.com/fine-tuning-gemma-3/).
