# Fine-tuning RF-DETR  

This repository contains a checkpoint directory and a scripts directory. Checkpoint directory includes checkpoints of fine-tuned RF-DETR model, fine-tuned on aquatic dataset containing a total of 7 classes. Scripts directory contains two .py files, 

1. yolo_to_coco.py: this script is used to convert YOLO format dataset into COCO format.
2. inferencing_with_RFDETR.py: this script is used to perform inferencing on RF-DETR.

This is a part of the LearnOpenCV blog post - [Fine-tuning RF-DETR](https://learnopencv.com/rf-detr-object-detection/).
