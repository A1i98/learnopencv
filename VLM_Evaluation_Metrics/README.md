## VLM Evaluation Metrics
This repository contains code for the blog post [Top VLM Evaluation Metrics for Optimal Performance Analysis](https://learnopencv.com/vlm-evaluation-metrics/).
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are powerful and figuring out how well they actually work is a real challenge. There isnâ€™t one single test that covers everything they can do. Instead, we need to use the right datasets and the right VLM Evaluation Metrics.
