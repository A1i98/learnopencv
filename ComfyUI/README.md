# ComfyUI

This repository contains the script to perform inferencing on Stable Diffusion using ComfyUI, which lets you design and execute advanced stable diffusion pipelines using a graph/nodes/flowchart based interface. 

In this repository we are providing an easy workflow JSON file that can be downloaded and dragged and dropped in the ComfyUI interface to directly run and experiment on.

This is a part of the LearnOpenCV blog post - [ComfyUI](https://learnopencv.com/introduction-to-comfyui-for-stable-diffusion/).
